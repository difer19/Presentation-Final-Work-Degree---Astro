# General Objective 
This degree work aims to implement a parallel algorithm based on Minimax applied to a game and perform its formal verification using concurrent process algebra and mCRL2. 

# Specific Objectives 
- Implement a parallel version of the Minimax algorithm in a selected game using a programming language to perform a formal verification of it. 
- Formally represent the algorithm's behavior using concurrent process algebra for analysis and subsequent verification. 
- Perform formal algorithm verification using mCRL2 to ensure the algorithm's behavior is correct and error-free.
